# Burning-Tree-(Alpha)-
This is a 2D Turn Based Combat style Game I made using Godot Engine 3.6. I used Godot's built in GDScript programming language for the code. I made the art assets from scratch using Gimp and Sketchbook. I also wrote the game's story. You play as a Firefighter in charge of defeating a walking tree on fire.
You can play it on PC through Safari and Chrome using my Github Pages link.

Note: It's still in its Alpha Stage with some bugs and designs that still need to be ironed out.

# Burning-Tree-(Alpha)-
This is a 2D Turn Based Combat style Game I made using Godot Engine 3.6. I used Godot's built in GDScript programming language for the code and Gimp to create the sprites and assets from scratch. I also wrote the game's story. You play as a Firefighter in charge of defeating a walking tree on fire. It's still in its Alpha Stage with some bugs and designs that still need to be ironed out.
